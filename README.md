An example fullstack cross-platform application with machine learning integrations for iOS, Android and the Web.
<hr>
</h3>

## Expo `app/` Prerequisites

- `nvm` (Node Version Manager) and the long-term supported (LTS) verion of Node.js (I'm using Node 22.14), which you can download here: https://nodejs.org/en/download.
- `npm`
- iOS Simulator (for Mac) and/or Android Emulator OR an physical iOS or Android device with the Expo Go app installed.

## Express `api/` Prerequisites
Please see the `README.md` for setting up and running the Express and Flask APIs.

## Running Entire Project
Let's get access to the full-stack cross-platform Expo app and it's machine learning features ‚ú®.

### Starting the Project
You are going to need two separate terminals, whether through a integrated or seperate from your code editor.

#### Starting the Express API
First, open a new terminal and navigate to the `api/` subproject from the root of this repo with the following command:
```bash
$ cd api
```
Next, once all depedencies for the the subproject are install and ready to run, run the API project with the following command:
```bash
api $ npm start
```

#### Starting the Expo App
Second, in a seperate terminal in the root of this repo, run the following command:
```bash
$ npm start
```
### Running the Expo App

#### On iOS
Scan the barcode that appears (you may need to scroll back up) in the terminal for the Expo app if you have a physical iOS device, or simply press "i" if you have an iOS simulator on your Mac open.

#### On Android
Scan the barcode that appears (you may need to scroll back up) in the terminal for the Expo app if you have a physical Android device, or simply press "a" if you have an iOS simulator on your Mac open.

### On the Web
Simply press "w" if you have an iOS simulator on your Mac open.

## Step-by-Step Build Guide

### 1. Initial Setup

```bash
# Create a new Expo project
npx create-expo-app@latest .
```

### 2. Install Core Dependencies

#### Install NativeWind
Follow the guide for installing and configuring NativeWind for styling available in the offical NativeWind documentation here: https://www.nativewind.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#installation-with-expo

#### Install React Native Maps
```bash
npx expo install react-native-maps
```
