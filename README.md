An example fullstack cross-platform application with machine learning integrations for iOS, Android and the Web.
<hr>
</h3>

## Expo `app/` Prerequisites

- `nvm` (Node Version Manager) and the long-term supported (LTS) verion of Node.js (I'm using Node 22.14), which you can download here: https://nodejs.org/en/download.
- `npm`
- iOS Simulator (for Mac) and/or Android Emulator OR an physical iOS or Android device with the Expo Go app installed.

## Express `api/` Prerequisites
Please see the `README.md` for setting up and running the Express and Flask APIs.

## Running Entire Project
Let's get access to the full-stack cross-platform Expo app and it's machine learning features ‚ú®.

### Starting the Project
You are going to need two separate terminals, whether through a integrated or seperate from your code editor.

#### Starting the Express API
First, open a new terminal and navigate to the `api/` subproject from the root of this repo with the following command:
```bash
$ cd api
```
Next, once all depedencies for the the subproject are install and ready to run, run the API project with the following command:
```bash
api $ npm start
```

#### Starting the Expo App
Second, in a seperate terminal in the root of this repo, run the following command:
```bash
$ npm start
```
### Running the Expo App

#### On iOS
Scan the barcode that appears (you may need to scroll back up) in the terminal for the Expo app if you have a physical iOS device, or simply press "i" if you have an iOS simulator on your Mac open.

#### On Android
Scan the barcode that appears (you may need to scroll back up) in the terminal for the Expo app if you have a physical Android device, or simply press "a" if you have an iOS simulator on your Mac open.

#### On the Web
Simply press "w" if you have an iOS simulator on your Mac open.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
2. Clear the Metro bundler cache: `npx expo start -c`
3. Delete your `node_modules/` folder and reinstall the project dependencies for either the Expo app or AI subproject with the command `npm install`.
