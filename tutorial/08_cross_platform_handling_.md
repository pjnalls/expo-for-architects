# Chapter 8: Cross-Platform Handling

Welcome back! In our previous chapter, [Machine Learning Integration](07_machine_learning_integration_.md), we saw how our backend can integrate with specialized processes like a Python ML script. We've also learned how our frontend talks to the backend, manages shared data, sets up navigation, and uses themed components.

Now, let's tackle a crucial challenge in building apps for multiple environments: **making the app work correctly and look good on different platforms.** Our project aims to run on iOS phones, Android phones, and in web browsers, but these environments are not identical!

Imagine you're an architect designing a building that will be constructed in different locations with varied climates â€“ say, a cold, snowy region and a hot, sunny desert. You wouldn't use the exact same building materials and design features for both! You'd need to:

*   Use specific materials or insulation suitable for each climate.
*   Maybe add features like snow-load support for roofs in snowy areas or extra shade in sunny regions.
*   Design the interior layout to be similar, but allow for differences in windows or heating/cooling systems.

Building a cross-platform application with Expo is similar. While Expo and React Native allow us to share a lot of code between iOS, Android, and Web, there are times when:

1.  A feature is only available on one platform (e.g., native Apple Maps features).
2.  A UI element looks or behaves slightly differently and needs adjustments.
3.  A piece of code needs to interact with a native platform API that is unique to iOS or Android.
4.  A library might have different implementations for different platforms, or might not support all platforms (like web).

**Cross-Platform Handling** refers to the strategies we use in our code to address these differences, ensuring a smooth and functional experience for users regardless of the device they're using.

### The Use Case: Displaying Maps

A perfect example in our project that highlights the need for cross-platform handling is the **Maps** feature (used in the Explore tab). Displaying interactive maps involves using native map components provided by the operating system: Apple Maps on iOS and Google Maps on Android. Furthermore, `expo-maps`, the library we use, **does not support the web platform** at all.

This single feature requires different code paths depending on whether the app is running on iOS, Android, or Web.

### Strategies for Cross-Platform Handling

React Native and Expo provide powerful built-in tools to help with this:

1.  **Conditional Logic using `Platform.OS`:** Inside a single `.tsx` file, you can use the `Platform.OS` variable to run different code or apply different styles based on the current platform.
2.  **Platform-Specific File Extensions:** You can create separate files for the same component or module, adding `.ios`, `.android`, or `.web` before the file extension (`.tsx`, `.js`, etc.). Expo/React Native will automatically load the correct file for the current platform.
3.  **Libraries that Abstract Differences:** Many popular libraries, like `expo-maps` itself, try to provide a unified API while using platform-specific native code under the hood. However, you still often need to use platform-specific components or props from these libraries.

Let's look at how our project uses these strategies for the Maps feature and other components.

### Strategy 1: Conditional Logic with `Platform.OS`

The `Platform` module from `react-native` exposes `Platform.OS`, which will be the string `'ios'`, `'android'`, or `'web'` depending on where the app is running. You can use simple `if` statements or ternary operators based on this value.

Look at the main `components/feat/Maps.tsx` file:

```typescript
// components/feat/Maps.tsx (Simplified)
import { Platform, StyleSheet, Text, View } from "react-native";
import { AppleMaps, GoogleMaps } from "expo-maps";
// ... other imports

const SF_ZOOM = 12;

export default function Maps() {
  // ... state and logic for camera position, etc.

  if (Platform.OS === "ios") { // Check if running on iOS
    return (
      // Use AppleMaps.View specifically for iOS
      <AppleMaps.View
        // ... iOS-specific props like 'annotations'
        markers={markersApple} // Use iOS-specific marker data
        // ... other iOS props and event handlers
      />
    );
  }
  else if (Platform.OS === "android") { // Check if running on Android
    return (
      // Use GoogleMaps.View specifically for Android
      <GoogleMaps.View
        // ... Android-specific props
        markers={markersGoogle} // Use Android-specific marker data
        // ... other Android props and event handlers
      />
    );
  }
  else { // Handle other platforms (like web if it wasn't handled by file extensions)
    return <Text>Maps are only available on Android and iOS</Text>;
  }
}

// ... styles and marker data (markersApple, markersGoogle)
```

Explanation:

*   We import the `Platform` module from `react-native`.
*   Inside the `Maps` component, we use `if (Platform.OS === "ios")` to check if the current platform is iOS. If it is, we render the `AppleMaps.View` component provided by `expo-maps`, which is specifically for iOS's native maps. We also pass iOS-specific data like `markersApple`.
*   We use `else if (Platform.OS === "android")` for the same check for Android. If true, we render `GoogleMaps.View` and pass Android-specific data like `markersGoogle`.
*   The final `else` block catches any other platform. In this case, we just display a message because `expo-maps` doesn't support web. (Note: As we'll see next, the web case is also handled by a platform-specific file in this project).

This allows us to keep platform-specific rendering logic within a single component file, which is useful when the *overall structure* is the same but specific child components or props differ.

### Strategy 2: Platform-Specific File Extensions

A cleaner way to handle larger differences or entirely separate implementations is using platform-specific file extensions.

If you have a file named `MyComponent.tsx`, you can create:

*   `MyComponent.ios.tsx`: This file will be loaded and used *only* on iOS.
*   `MyComponent.android.tsx`: This file will be loaded and used *only* on Android.
*   `MyComponent.web.tsx`: This file will be loaded and used *only* on Web.
*   `MyComponent.tsx`: This file acts as a fallback. It will be used on any platform that doesn't have a specific matching file, or it can contain common code that is imported by the platform-specific files.

When you import `MyComponent` like this:

```typescript
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
```

Expo/React Native's build process automatically looks for and prioritizes the platform-specific file before falling back to the base `.tsx` file.

Let's see how this is used for Maps and Icons in our project:

**Maps:**

*   `components/feat/Maps.tsx`: Contains the iOS and Android implementations using `Platform.OS` checks, as shown above. It serves as the *default* or mobile implementation here.
*   `components/feat/Maps.web.tsx`: Provides a completely different implementation *just for the web*.

```typescript
// components/feat/Maps.web.tsx
import ThemedContainer from '../ThemedContainer';
import { ThemedText } from '../ThemedText';

export default function Maps() { // Same component name, different file
  return (
    <ThemedContainer className="flex flex-1 justify-center items-center">
        {/* Simple text message for web */}
        <ThemedText className="text-2xl text-center">Maps is not available on web.</ThemedText>
    </ThemedContainer>
  );
}
```

When the app runs on the web, because `components/feat/Maps.web.tsx` exists, the import `import Maps from '@/components/feat/Maps'` automatically resolves to this file instead of `components/feat/Maps.tsx`. The user sees the simple message instead of trying to load native map components that don't exist on the web.

**Icons:**

Another great example is the `IconSymbol` component in `components/ui/`.

*   `components/ui/IconSymbol.ios.tsx`: Uses the `expo-symbols` library to render native **SF Symbols** on iOS, providing a truly native icon experience.

```typescript
// components/ui/IconSymbol.ios.tsx (Simplified)
import { SymbolView, SymbolViewProps } from 'expo-symbols';
import { StyleProp, ViewStyle } from 'react-native';

export function IconSymbol({ // Same component name, .ios.tsx file
  name, // This 'name' is an SF Symbol name (e.g., 'house.fill')
  size = 24,
  color,
  style,
  // ... other props
}: {
  name: SymbolViewProps['name'];
  size?: number;
  color: string;
  style?: StyleProp<ViewStyle>;
}) {
  return (
    // Use the native SymbolView component
    <SymbolView
      tintColor={color}
      name={name} // Pass the SF Symbol name
      style={[{ width: size, height: size, }, style ]}
    />
  );
}
```

*   `components/ui/IconSymbol.tsx`: This is the default file. It's used for **Android and Web**. Since SF Symbols are an Apple technology, we can't use them here. Instead, this file uses the `@expo/vector-icons` library (specifically MaterialIcons) as a fallback. It includes a manual mapping from the requested SF Symbol name to a similar MaterialIcons name.

```typescript
// components/ui/IconSymbol.tsx (Simplified - Used for Android and Web)
import MaterialIcons from '@expo/vector-icons/MaterialIcons';
import React from 'react';
import { StyleProp, TextStyle } from 'react-native';

// Manual mapping from SF Symbol names to MaterialIcons names
const MAPPING = {
  'house.fill': 'home',
  'paperplane.fill': 'send',
  // ... other mappings
} as Partial<Record< // Type definition...
    import('expo-symbols').SymbolViewProps['name'],
    React.ComponentProps<typeof MaterialIcons>['name']
>>;

// Define the names this component accepts based on the mapping keys
export type IconSymbolName = keyof typeof MAPPING;

export function IconSymbol({ // Same component name, default .tsx file
  name, // The SF Symbol name requested
  size = 24,
  color,
  style,
  // weight prop is ignored here as MaterialIcons don't have weights
}: {
  name: IconSymbolName;
  size?: number;
  color: string;
  style?: StyleProp<TextStyle>;
  weight?: any; // Accepts weight prop but doesn't use it
}) {
  // Look up the corresponding MaterialIcons name from the mapping
  return <MaterialIcons color={color} size={size} name={MAPPING[name]} style={style} />;
}
```

When you use `<IconSymbol name="house.fill" color="blue" />` in your code:
*   On iOS, the build system finds `IconSymbol.ios.tsx` and uses the `SymbolView` to render a native SF Symbol.
*   On Android or Web, the build system falls back to `IconSymbol.tsx`, which renders a MaterialIcons icon named 'home' (because of the mapping).

This is a powerful way to provide platform-optimized or platform-required implementations transparently to the components that use them.

**Tab Bar Background:**

Another subtle example is the tab bar background in `components/ui/`:

*   `components/ui/TabBarBackground.ios.tsx`: Uses `expo-blur` to add a native-looking blur effect behind the tab bar on iOS.
*   `components/ui/TabBarBackground.tsx`: The default file is simply `undefined` or a placeholder, as Android and Web typically don't use this specific blur effect or handle tab bar backgrounds differently.

### How Expo Handles Platform-Specific Files

Let's visualize how the build system selects the correct file:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant YourCode as Your Code
    participant BuildSystem as Expo/RN Build System
    participant Filesystem as Filesystem
    participant TargetPlatform as Target Platform (e.g., iOS)

    YourCode->>BuildSystem: import MyComponent from './MyComponent'
    BuildSystem->>Filesystem: Look for ./MyComponent.ios.tsx (if target is iOS)
    alt If .ios.tsx found
        Filesystem-->>BuildSystem: Found ./MyComponent.ios.tsx
        BuildSystem->>TargetPlatform: Use code from ./MyComponent.ios.tsx
    else If not found (or target is Android/Web)
        BuildSystem->>Filesystem: Look for ./MyComponent.android.tsx (if target is Android)
        alt If .android.tsx found
            Filesystem-->>BuildSystem: Found ./MyComponent.android.tsx
            BuildSystem->>TargetPlatform: Use code from ./MyComponent.android.tsx
        else If not found (or target is Web)
            BuildSystem->>Filesystem: Look for ./MyComponent.web.tsx (if target is Web)
            alt If .web.tsx found
                Filesystem-->>BuildSystem: Found ./MyComponent.web.tsx
                BuildSystem->>TargetPlatform: Use code from ./MyComponent.web.tsx
            else If none found
                BuildSystem->>Filesystem: Look for ./MyComponent.tsx (fallback)
                Filesystem-->>BuildSystem: Found ./MyComponent.tsx
                BuildSystem->>TargetPlatform: Use code from ./MyComponent.tsx
            end
        end
    end
```

This diagram shows the search order: Platform-specific (`.ios`, `.android`, `.web`) first, then the base file (`.tsx`).

### Strategy 3: Libraries with Platform Abstraction

Libraries like `expo-maps` provide components (`AppleMaps.View`, `GoogleMaps.View`) that hide some complexity. You use components from the *same library*, but you need to be aware that they are different and might require different props or behave differently, often necessitating `Platform.OS` checks as shown earlier. Other libraries might have a single component name but render different native views internally. Understanding the library's documentation is key here.

### Benefits of These Strategies

*   **Code Organization:** Keeps platform-specific logic out of your main component files, making them cleaner and easier to read.
*   **Maintainability:** If you need to fix an iOS-specific bug or add an Android-specific feature, you know exactly which file (`.ios.tsx` or `.android.tsx`) to modify.
*   **Performance:** Only the code relevant to the current platform is included in the final app bundle, keeping the app size smaller and potentially improving load times.
*   **Native Look and Feel:** Allows you to leverage native components and features (like SF Symbols on iOS or specific map views) that provide a better user experience on each platform.

### Conclusion

Cross-platform handling is essential for building robust applications that look and function well across iOS, Android, and Web. We learned about the key strategies: using `Platform.OS` for conditional logic within a file, employing platform-specific file extensions (`.ios`, `.android`, `.web`) for entirely different implementations, and leveraging libraries that abstract platform differences (while sometimes still requiring platform-aware code). By effectively using these techniques, we can create applications that feel tailored to each platform while maximizing code sharing.

This concludes our journey through the `expo-for-architects` tutorial! We've covered everything from project structure and navigation to state management, API interactions, backend development, machine learning integration, and finally, making sure it all works smoothly across different devices.
