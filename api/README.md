- Python 3 should be installed (I'm using Python 3.11 at the start of this project), which you can download here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- A virtual environment created with a tool such as `venv`, which you can learn how to set up here: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/

## Installing Node.js Project Dependencies
Run the following command:
```bash
api $ npm install
```

## Installing Python Project Dependencies 
### via `venv`
Once you create a `venv` virtual environment inside a clone of this repo, run the following command:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### via `conda`
The `requirements.txt` file may be used to create an environment using the following commad:
```bash
